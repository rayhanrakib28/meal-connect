# MealConnect Project Description

- Our project focuses on building a Community Food Sharing Platform, and
  we're seeking a front-end web developer. Using technologies like React,
  Firebase, Node.js (Express js) , and MongoDB, we aim to connect those
  with surplus food to those in need, reducing food waste and addressing
  hunger. Join us to create a user-friendly, socially impactful platform that
  promotes sustainability and community cooperation.
